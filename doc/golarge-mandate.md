## Give — You're not losing; you're planting
There was once a farmer who loved his land. Every year, he planted his best seeds, not the leftovers. His neighbors often mocked him, saying, "Why waste the best? Keep the finest for yourself."

But he always smiled and said, "I'm not losing seed; I'm planting a future."

One year, a drought came. Fields all around him dried up, but his crops still grew — strong, green, and fruitful. His secret? The good seed he had sown in faith had deeper roots.

That's how giving to God works. When you give, you're not losing; you're planting into soil that never fails. Every seed you release creates a future you cannot yet see — in opportunities, favor, peace, and generations to come.

> "Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over."  
> — Luke 6:38

Your giving is not subtraction — it's multiplication in disguise.

## 20 Years of Prayer Investment — It's Time to Impart Generational Blessings!

When Isaac was near the end of his life, he spoke a blessing over Jacob:

> "May God give you of the dew of heaven, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine. Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be master over your brethren, and let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be those who bless you!"  
> — Genesis 27:28–29

Jacob left his father's house with nothing but this blessing. Empty-handed, fleeing for his life, he journeyed to Assyria to live with his uncle Laban. For twenty years, that blessing guided and sustained him. Despite hardship and deceit, God prospered him in every way.

Jacob later testified:
> "These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock."  
> — Genesis 31:38, 41

And when he returned home, he declared:
> "I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two companies."  
> — Genesis 32:10

The blessing turned one man with nothing into a man with nations. In just 20 years, the blessing made him two companies!

No investment on earth can match the return of God's blessing.

For too long, we have focused on breaking generational curses. But the next generation — Generation Z and Generation Alpha— is rising to walk in the reality of God's blessings. It is the blessing that nullifies curses. It is the blessing that preserves destinies and multiplies generations.

Now is the time to impart generational blessings!
